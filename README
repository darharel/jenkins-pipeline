Weather Forecast Web App
This is a Python Flask web app that shows a 7-day weather forecast for any city. It uses the Open Meteo API for weather data, AWS S3 to download a sky image, and AWS DynamoDB to store a sample record.

Main Features:
Enter a city and get a 7-day forecast with temperature, humidity, and weekday display.
Button to download a sky image from S3.
Button to send a sample record to DynamoDB.
Simple HTML frontend using Jinja2 templating.
Tested with a basic unittest script.
Dockerized and production-ready using Gunicorn.

CI/CD Pipeline:
Jenkinsfile builds the Docker image, runs the container, executes tests, pushes the image to DockerHub, and deploys it to an EC2 instance over SSH.

Project Files:
weather.py – Main Flask application.
tests.py – Unit test to check the homepage is reachable.
index.html – The frontend template (under templates/).
Dockerfile – Prepares the app image using python:3 and installs Flask, Gunicorn, boto3, and requests.
Jenkinsfile – Handles the pipeline logic.

How to Run Locally:
Build the image: docker build -t weather-app .
Run the container: docker run -d -p 5000:8000 weather-app
Visit http://localhost:5000 to use the app.

Run tests: python3 tests.py
